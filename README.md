# üîç **Linux Looker** üîç
## Automated Linux Diagnostic Tool for Quick System Insights

### **Extended Overview**

**Linux Looker** is a modular Python-based diagnostic tool that provides users with a fast, efficient, and color-coded way to inspect the health of their Linux systems. Designed with intermediate Linux users in mind, it eliminates the need to memorize complex CLI commands by bundling multiple system health checks into one tool.

## **Key Selling Points**

- **Simplicity**: No need to run separate commands or remember complex syntax. With an intuitive menu system, users can easily navigate and execute the tools.

- **Quick Insights**: The tool is modular, allowing you to run individual scans or all tools at once for a comprehensive system report. This flexibility makes it ideal for both targeted diagnostics and full system checks.

- **Credentialed and Non-Credentialed Scans**: Our tool supports both credentialed (sudo-required) and non-credentialed scans. The credentialed scans request a sudo password for that specific run and never store or save any sensitive information. For each new scan that requires elevated privileges, the password must be entered again, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

- **Security & Privacy**: We are privacy-conscious and take security seriously. The sudo password is only used during the run of the tool for necessary scans and is discarded immediately after. No data or passwords are stored in the system or saved between sessions.

- **Color-Coded Output**: To enhance readability, the results are presented in a clear, color-coded format. Important sections, system information, and warnings are easy to identify at a glance.

- **Immediate Reports**: All output is automatically saved as neatly formatted text files on your desktop. This allows you to review past results without needing to re-run any commands, providing both convenience and efficiency.

- **Small Footprint**: The tool is lightweight, with a total size of only **29.8 MB**, ensuring it won't take up unnecessary space on your system.

Imagine having all the most critical system health data‚Äînetwork information, firewall status, system memory, logs‚Äîavailable in one place and color-coded for easy readability. Whether you‚Äôre troubleshooting an isolated issue like a slow internet connection or scanning your whole system for performance bottlenecks, **Linux Looker** saves time by providing the information in one go.

### **Key Features**

1. **DNS Information üåê**  
   Provides detailed information on DNS records, including A, AAAA, MX, TXT, PTR, and SOA records, along with DNSSEC status and TTL values.

2. **Memory and Disk Usage üíæ**  
   Displays RAM and swap usage, disk space stats, and lists the top three memory-consuming processes.

3. **Firewall Information üî•**  
   Shows firewall status, open ports, and configured firewall rules.

4. **Interface Information üñß**  
   Displays network interface status, including IP addresses, subnet masks, and error statistics.

5. **Routing Table and Traceroute üó∫**  
   Shows the system's routing table and performs a traceroute to identify network paths.

6. **Net Speed Test, IP, Ping ‚ö°**  
   Checks download/upload speeds, public/private IP addresses, and measures network latency using ping.

7. **System Logs (Last 10) üìú**  
   Pulls the last 10 logs from key services like authentication, firewall, and kernel logs.

8. **System Info & ARP üñ•Ô∏è**  
   Provides system information (CPU, RAM, uptime) and shows the ARP table with MAC-to-IP mappings.

### **Running the Tools Together or Separately**

- You can run individual tools by selecting them from the menu, or you can run all tools at once for a full system diagnostic.
- The output is neatly organized into text files saved to your desktop for easy reference.

### **Advanced Use Cases:**

- **DNS and Network Troubleshooting:**
  - **Tools**: DNS Information, Routing Table, Net Speed Test.
  - **Scenario**: You're having trouble accessing certain websites or services. Start with DNS Information to verify the DNS records, use Routing Table to check if the network paths are correct, and finally run the Net Speed Test to rule out speed or latency issues.

- **Security Audit:**
  - **Tools**: Firewall Information, System Logs, ARP Table.
  - **Scenario**: You're auditing your system for unauthorized access or suspicious activity. Begin with Firewall Information to ensure the firewall is correctly configured, then check System Logs for recent login attempts, and finally inspect the ARP Table for unauthorized devices on the network.

- **Performance Bottleneck:**
  - **Tools**: Memory and Disk Usage, Interface Information, Net Speed Test.
  - **Scenario**: Your system feels slow, and you're unsure if it's memory-related, disk, or network. Check Memory and Disk Usage to spot any memory hogs, use Interface Information to verify there are no interface errors, and then run Net Speed Test to see if network bandwidth is the issue.
