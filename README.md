## Automated Linux Diagnostic Tool for Quick System Insights

### Extended Overview

**Linux Looker** is a modular, security-focused diagnostic tool for Linux systems that provides quick, detailed insights into system health. It includes eight diagnostic tools, covering DNS, memory, disk usage, firewall, network interfaces, routing, speed tests, logs, and system information. Users can run individual or multiple tools as needed, with results color-coded for readability and saved as text files on the desktop. **Linux Looker** prioritizes security by discarding the sudo password after each run.

### Key Features
- üåê **DNS Information**: Provides detailed information on DNS records, including A, AAAA, MX, TXT, PTR, and SOA records, along with DNSSEC status and TTL values.
- üíæ **Memory and Disk Usage**: Displays RAM and swap usage, disk space stats, and lists the top three memory-consuming processes.
- üî• **Firewall Information**: Shows firewall status, open ports, and configured firewall rules.
- üñß **Interface Information**: Displays network interface status, including IP addresses, subnet masks, and error statistics.
- üó∫ **Routing Table and Traceroute**: Shows the system's routing table and performs a traceroute to identify network paths.
- ‚ö° **Net Speed Test, IP, Ping**: Checks download/upload speeds, public/private IP addresses, and measures network latency using ping.
- üìú **System Logs (Last 10)**: Pulls the last 10 logs from key services like authentication, firewall, and kernel logs.
- üñ•Ô∏è **System Info & ARP**: Provides system information (CPU, RAM, uptime) and shows the ARP table with MAC-to-IP mappings.
